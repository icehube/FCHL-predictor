# FCHL Predictor

A personal Streamlit app that simulates the remaining 2025-26 NHL season and projects fantasy points for 6 FCHL teams. Feed it different roster configurations to compare projected final standings.

## Features

- **Schedule-accurate projections** — remaining games counted from the actual 2025-26 NHL schedule
- **Per-game rate model** — skater goals/assists projected from season-to-date pace
- **Goalie tracking** — wins and shutouts derived from completed schedule results
- **Roster Builder** — swap players between teams to evaluate trades or lineup changes
- **Editable standings** — update each team's current point total in the sidebar

## Scoring

| Stat    | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Goal    | 1      |
| Assist  | 1      |
| Win     | 2      |
| Shutout | 3      |

## Setup
